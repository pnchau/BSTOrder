# BSTOrder
Program makes a binary search tree based on what user inputs and then tells the user what order the tree is in such as inorder, preorder, or postorder.

The program can read commands such as insert remove and traverse.

Insert
20 10 30 15 25
Traverse
20 10 15 30 25
Remove
10
Traverse
15 20 25 30
Insert
12
Traverse
-1

Here the program will output 

Preorder
Inorder
False

False will happen because -1 is not in the tree.

Currently the program is set up to just read input1.txt and will make a new output file.
